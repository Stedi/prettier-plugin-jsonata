JSONata with custom Stedi functions

## FAQ

### Why is _jsonata_ pinned to version `1.7.0`?

The _jsonata_ [serialize we use](https://github.com/Stedi/jsonata-ui-core) in the terminal originally was developed for version `1.7.x`.
To ensure compatibility between this package and the serializer, we have decided to pin the _jsonata_ version to `1.7.0`.
